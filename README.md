# No-show-appointments data analysis project:
This is one of my projects for Data Analyst -Udacity nano degree-

## dataset
No-show-appointments dataset has information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:
    1- ScheduledDay: tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment 
    2- Neighborhood: indicates the location of the hospital
    3- Scholarship: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia. 
 
 ## analysis 
In this report, I will invistigate what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment. Especially, I will explore the relationship between the scholarship and no-show. Also, I will look into patient's age and health condition to see if they have effect on no-show. Finally, I will check if receiving SMS-reminders would make patient show-up"
